# Example SealedSecret - This is what a sealed secret looks like after encryption
# DO NOT use this file directly - generate your own using kubeseal
#
# This is safe to commit to Git because:
# 1. The encryptedData can only be decrypted by the Sealed Secrets controller
# 2. It's bound to a specific namespace
# 3. It's bound to a specific cluster (the one with the matching private key)
